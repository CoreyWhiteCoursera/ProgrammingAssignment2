## Name:        Programming Assignment 2 for R Programming on Coursera
## Author:      Corey White
## Description: A pair of functions to calculate and cache the inverse of an
##              invertible matrix.


## Create a special "matrix" object (really a list) that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Extend the "solve" function to invert a matrix x, using a cached inverse if it
## has already been calculated. Additional arguments are passed through to Solve.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
